Window functions are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Unlike traditional aggregate functions, which collapse the rows into a single output row, window functions retain the individual rows while still allowing you to perform calculations that take into account more than just the current row.

### Key Concepts of Window Functions

- **OVER() Clause**: This is what defines the "window" or set of rows the function operates over. Within the OVER() clause, you can specify partitioning, ordering, and the rows that precede and follow the current row.
- **PARTITION BY**: This divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied. If not specified, the window function is applied to all rows in the result set.
- **ORDER BY**: This orders the rows within each partition or the entire result set if PARTITION BY is not specified.
- **Frame Specification**: This allows you to define the set of rows used by the window function related to the current row, for example, "ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING".

### Common Window Functions

1. **ROW_NUMBER()**: Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition of a result set, starting at 1 for the first row in each partition.

2. **RANK()**: Assigns a rank to each row within a partition of a result set, with gaps in the ranking for tied rows.

3. **DENSE_RANK()**: Similar to RANK(), but without gaps in the ranking for tied rows.

4. **LEAD()**: Provides access to a row at a specified physical offset following the current row within the partition.

5. **LAG()**: Provides access to a row at a specified physical offset preceding the current row within the partition.

6. **SUM()**, **AVG()**, **MIN()**, **MAX()**: Performs the respective aggregate operation across the rows in the window frame.

### Example Usage

Let's say we have a table `sales (employee_id, sale_date, sale_amount)` and we want to analyze sales data for each employee.

#### ROW_NUMBER()

```sql
SELECT employee_id, sale_date, sale_amount,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS sale_rank
FROM sales;
```
This query assigns a unique sequential number to each sale for each employee based on the sale date.

#### LEAD()

```sql
SELECT employee_id, sale_date, sale_amount,
       LEAD(sale_amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id ORDER BY sale_date) AS next_sale_amount
FROM sales;
```
This query shows each sale's amount along with the amount of the next sale for each employee.

#### SUM() with Frame Specification

```sql
SELECT employee_id, sale_date, sale_amount,
       SUM(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY employee_id ORDER BY sale_date
                              ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_sum_sale_amount
FROM sales;
```
This calculates a rolling sum of sales, including the current sale and the one immediately preceding it, for each employee.

### Benefits of Window Functions

- **Performance**: Often more efficient than equivalent SQL statements using subqueries or joins, especially for complex analytical queries.
- **Simplicity**: Can simplify SQL queries, making them easier to write and understand compared to complex joins and subqueries.
- **Flexibility**: Provide powerful data analysis capabilities directly in SQL without needing to process the data in application code.

Window functions are indispensable for data analysis and reporting, offering SQL developers the ability to write concise and efficient queries for complex data analysis tasks.
